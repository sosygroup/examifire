	/*
	 * @ManyToOne operates on the so called logical model, i.e. the object-oriented
	 * side of the object-relational mapping. The semantics of optional=false here
	 * are:
	 * 
	 * Whether the association is optional. If set to false then a non-null
	 * relationship must always exist.
	 * 
	 * So the JPA engine expects that the underlying storage will always provide a
	 * value that can be translated to a User object.
	 * 
	 * @JoinColumn operates on the physical model, i.e. how things are actually laid
	 * down in the datastore (database). Specifying nullable = false will make the
	 * DB column non-nullable.
	 * 
	 * If @JoinColumn(nullable = false) was omitted, the column would be nullable.
	 * One could insert a null value there and the DB would happily accept it.
	 * However if someone tried to read that value through JPA, the JPA engine would
	 * protest because it expects a value that can be translated to a User object to
	 * always be there, as specified by @ManyToOne(optional = false).
